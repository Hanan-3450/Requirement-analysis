# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

It serves as a foundational project focused on understanding and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development.

The goal is to learn how to:
- Gather and define clear requirements
- Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements
- Create diagrams and documentation that explain system features and behavior
- Write effective acceptance criteria to guide project success

  ## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a key phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where we identify, gather, and define the needs and expectations of users, customers, and stakeholders for a software system. 

The goal is to make sure that the development team understands **what** needs to be built before starting the actual coding. This phase helps avoid misunderstandings, incomplete features, or costly changes later in the project.

### Importance in SDLC
-  It provides a clear roadmap of what the system should do.
-  It helps identify functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform) requirements early.
-  It reduces risks by ensuring everyone has a shared understanding.
-  It sets the foundation for design, development, and testing phases.
