# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

It serves as a foundational project focused on understanding and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development.

The goal is to learn how to:
- Gather and define clear requirements
- Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements
- Create diagrams and documentation that explain system features and behavior
- Write effective acceptance criteria to guide project success

  ## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a key phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where we identify, gather, and define the needs and expectations of users, customers, and stakeholders for a software system. 

The goal is to make sure that the development team understands **what** needs to be built before starting the actual coding. This phase helps avoid misunderstandings, incomplete features, or costly changes later in the project.

### Importance in SDLC
-  It provides a clear roadmap of what the system should do.
-  It helps identify functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system should perform) requirements early.
-  It reduces risks by ensuring everyone has a shared understanding.
-  It sets the foundation for design, development, and testing phases.

  ## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in ensuring software projects are successful. Here are some key reasons why it is important in the SDLC:

1️. **Clear Understanding of Needs:**  
It ensures that the development team fully understands what the users, customers, and stakeholders expect. This prevents building the wrong product.

2️. **Reduced Development Risks:**  
By identifying potential issues early in the process, Requirement Analysis helps avoid costly errors, delays, or major redesigns later on.

3️. **Better Planning and Design:**  
It provides a solid foundation for creating system designs, schedules, budgets, and testing plans. Good requirements lead to more accurate planning.



## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Here are the five key activities involved in the requirement analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  This is the process of collecting all the necessary requirements from stakeholders, clients, and end-users. It ensures that the project team understands what the users really need.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Elicitation involves techniques like interviews, questionnaires, workshops, and brainstorming to uncover hidden or unstated requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  After gathering and eliciting requirements, they are documented clearly and systematically (often in formats like user stories, use case diagrams, or requirement specification docs).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  This is where the team analyzes the requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. It may include visual modeling like diagrams or workflows to better understand the system.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Validation ensures that the documented requirements match what the stakeholders really need. This is often done via reviews, walkthroughs, and feedback sessions.

  ## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**. They define the features and functions the system must have to satisfy the user’s needs.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system must allow users to create, view, update, and cancel bookings.
- The system must send confirmation emails when a booking is made.
- The system must allow administrators to manage room availability.
- Users should be able to search for available rooms by date.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system performs** its functions. They focus on the system’s quality attributes.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should handle at least 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- The booking confirmation email should be sent within 30 seconds of booking completion.
- The system must be accessible on mobile and desktop devices.
- All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest to ensure security.


## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help stakeholders understand the system’s functionality at a glance and clarify system boundaries and responsibilities.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams**
- Clearly show how users interact with the system
- Help identify functional requirements early
- Simplify communication between technical and non-technical team members
