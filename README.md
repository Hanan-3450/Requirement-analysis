# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

It serves as a foundational project focused on understanding and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development.

The goal is to learn how to:
- Gather and define clear requirements
- Distinguish between functional and non-functional requirements
- Create diagrams and documentation that explain system features and behavior
- Write effective acceptance criteria to guide project success
